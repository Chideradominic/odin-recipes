    <h1>Awesome Broccoli Cheese Soup</h1>

        <p>Broccoli cheese soup, in case you needed reminding, is going to bring several good things into your life: a delicate start of butter and garlic and onions, a silky-smooth soup base, little bite-sized bits of just-right broccoli, thinly sliced carrots, and a sharp, creamy finish from that cheddar cheese. It’s flavorful, it’s veg-loaded and fresh, but it’s also extremely comforting, unassuming, and mellow. And I think we could all use a little more mellow right about now, yes?</p>

        <p> There’s salt, there’s pepper, and there’s paprika to season, but hello VERY IMPORTANT there’s also hot crusty bread for dipping.</p>

            <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
            <li>1 cup half and half</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2–3 cups broccoli florets, chopped into very small pieces</li>
            <li>1 large carrot, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (more or less to taste)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Sauté garlic and onion:</strong> In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, melt 1 tablespoon butter over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and broccoli stems; sauté until soft and fragrant, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Build your roux: </strong> Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter to the soup pot. When butter is melted, add flour to the pot. Cook over medium heat for about 2-3 minutes, until flour is thickened. Slowly pour in the milk and half and half, whisking constantly. (It will start thick but eventually it will thin out and resemble a creamy soup base.) Continue to thin it out, gradually whisking in the broth. Simmer for 10 minutes or so, whisking occasionally to reincorporate the skin that may form.</li>
            <li><strong>Add broccoli:</strong> When the soup base is thickened nicely, stir in the broccoli, carrots, and spices. Simmer for 10 minutes or so, until the broccoli bits are bright green and fork-tender.</li>
            <li><strong>Add cheese:</strong> Transfer the pot off of heat and allow to cool slightly for a few minutes. Stir in most of the cheese until melted. Serve in bowls with a little extra cheese + a hunk of crusty bread for dunking – and yes, it’s okay to cry tears of cozy joy! This is a happy moment!</li>
